    Github extension for VSCode: GitHub Pull Requests and Issues (may not need)

*****

To get started:

-Click on the Source Control icon on the left
-Clone repo
-Enter the url for the github repo (https://github.com/amillerParadigm/Templates.git)
-Select a spot to save to on your computer

**If you dont open files and save a new copy for every email you code:
    -After saving the repo to a folder on your computer, copy that folder to another folder that you can work on. This way you wont be working on the files that are linked to the github files and there is no worry of overwritting the templates. So youll have 2 folders with the same files. One will just hold the templates and is linked to github. The second is just a copy of all of the files that you can use to work on and code in.
    -When there are changes made to the templates, youll need to do a Pull in the orignal folder you saved, and then copy the new templates to your 2nd folder.
    -Maybe theres an easier way to do this?

**If you do save each email you code:
    -Open the file you need from the folder thats linked to github and do a file->save as to whereever you keep your emails


**

Pull - To get the latest changes to the templates from Github:

-Open your local repo folder in the explorer
-Go to the source control tab
-Under the "Source control repositories" section you should see your local folder with the templates
    -Click the 3 dots and click on "Pull"
-This will only overwrite the files that have changed

**Only needs to be done when changes are made and pushed to the templates on Github. 

For example, if we change Dougs signoff for some of the templates, youll need to do a Pull request to get the new versions onto your computer. We dont make many changes to the templates so this wont be something that needs to be done too often.

Commit and Push - Adding changes to files on Github

-Make your changes to the template file you have on your local machine
-Go to the source control tab
-Under the "Source Control" section you should see the files that have been changed (You may have to click on the refresh icon)
-When youre finished making changes, type in a message describing what changes you made to the file.
-Click the arrow next to the commit button and select "Commit & Push". This will change the file on Github.

******

Commit only - This will save your changes and add it to the "staging area" but it wont push changes to Github.

-After making changes to the file, enter a message and then click the "Commit" button
-To push to Github, click on the 3 dots next to your local folder name under the "Source Control Repositories" section and select "Push"
