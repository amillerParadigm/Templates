    MJML - the one with 32k downloads. This is the newer one that works fine. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mjmlio.vscode-mjml
    HTML Preview - I only use this for doing RETA and if i need to grab the html code from iterable to do a forward when the mjml code isnt available. There may be better extensions, i havent tried any other ones. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=george-alisson.html-preview-vscode

    Github extension for VSCode: GitHub Pull Requests and Issues (may not need)

*****

Pull - To get the latest changes to the templates from Github:

-Open your local repo folder in the explorer
-Go to the source control tab
-Under the "Source control repositories" section you should see your local folder with the templates
    -Click the 3 dots and click on "Pull"
-This will only overwrite the files that have changed

**Only needs to be done when changes are made and pushed to the templates on Github. 

For example, if we change Dougs signoff for some of the templates, youll need to do a Pull request to get the new versions onto your computer. We dont make many changes to the templates so this wont be something that needs to be done too often.

Commit and Push - Adding changes to files on Github

-Make your changes to the template file you have on your local machine
-Go to the source control tab
-Under the "Source Control" section you should see the files that have been changed (You may have to click on the refresh icon)
-When youre finished making changes, type in a message describing what changes you made to the file.
-Click the arrow next to the commit button and select "Commit & Push". This will change the file on Github.

******

Commit only - This will save your changes and add it to the "staging area" but it wont push changes to Github.

-After making changes to the file, enter a message and then click the "Commit" button
-To push to Github, click on the 3 dots next to your local folder name under the "Source Control Repositories" section and select "Push"
