Pull - To get the latest changes to the templates from Github:

-Open your local repo folder in the explorer
-Go to the source control tab
-Under the "Source control repositories" section you should see your local folder with the templates
    -Click the 3 dots and click on "Pull"
-This will only overwrite the files that have changed

**Only needs to be done when changes are made and pushed to the templates on Github. 

For example, if we change Dougs signoff for some of the templates, youll need to do a Pull request to get the new versions onto your computer. We dont make many changes to the templates so this wont be something that needs to be done too often.
